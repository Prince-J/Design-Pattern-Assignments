Implementing a receipt printing system using the 
Decorator Design Pattern.

The program prints out the base receipt and based on different
factors, such as the current date or the items purchased, "decorations"
such as a header, coupon, or rebate could be appended to the base receipt.

Classes used to implement this design pattern:
•BaseReceipt class
•ReceiptFactory class
•Decorator interface
•Pre/PostDecorator class
•StoreItem class
•AddOn interface
•Coupon class
•SecondaryHeader class
•Rebate class
•Date class
